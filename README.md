# 🍞 Sugarfern – Bakery Landing Page UI (Figma)

This is a simple, aesthetic bakery website landing page I designed on **Figma** as part of my UI/UX and front-end development learning journey.

I’m currently learning the foundations of web design, and this is one of my early hands-on attempts to improve my visual design skills and understand layout structure, typography, and component placement.
